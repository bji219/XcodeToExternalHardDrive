# XcodeToExternalHardDrive
My workaround for downloading and installing Xcode on an External Hard Drive to save space on my main HD.

Steps:

1. Create a new user for your mac.
2. Set the new user's home directory to be your external hard drive.
3. Log in as the new user and download the desired version of Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode
4. Unzip the file using the terminal command "xip -x"
